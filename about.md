Currently learning from the bootcamp 'Bedu - Santander: Desarrollo web fullstack con Javascript' (JS Fullstack Web Development - JS, Node.JS, Express, React). At the same time and also from Bedu I'm learning to develop Mobile Apps with Kotlin. Meanwhile I keep learning at my own pace from the Trailblazer by Salesforce to become a Salesforce Developer.

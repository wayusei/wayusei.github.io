Trying to do this 'by the book' seems quite awkward but let's improvise a bit...

Greetings from Veracruz, MX.

Hi! My name is Rodrigo Rosas Zamudio, a mexican who recently pivoted his career as Tech Support to become a developer. Encouraged primarily by necessity (raise three kids is just a bit hard with the current economy) and a natural curiosity about how the things work, motivated by other developers on Youtube, learning from every site, book, blog or video I came across and well... Here I am still learning, overcoming the FOMO, battling imposter syndrome everyday and the day after, improving myself to be the better me i can be.

From now on you'll be reading from me about my learning path, some book reviews I've been wanting to share, my personal POV on life and of course some occasional successful -or awful- experience (after all, why not?).
